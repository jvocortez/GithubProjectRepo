#User.py only shows the prompts being provided to the user when they first ran the Community Mental Health Tracker. In this partial code, the user is prompted to either log in, register, or exit. Once the user already has an account, they can proceed with logging in. Otherwise, they will need to register first.

#1 - Save the partial User.py code on your computer.
#2 - Once saved, locate where the partial code was saved.
#3 - Double click the address bar in order to highlight and edit it. Once done, type "cmd".
#4 - Once cmd is opened under the location where the partial code was saved, type "wsl" to switch over to the Ubuntu WSL Terminal. 
  *Note: Make sure that Ubuntu is installed on your computer, as well as Python being installed on Ubuntu itself, for you to proceed further.
#5 - Once your cmd successfully switched over to the Ubuntu WSL Terminal, type "<Python version> User.py".
  *In this case, type "python3 User.py" for you to incorporate the partial code onto the terminal.
